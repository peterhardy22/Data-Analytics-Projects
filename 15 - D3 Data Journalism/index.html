          <p class="lead">This data helps us look into how monetary things such as household income can effect someones longevity when
            it comes to health. The more financial freedom one possesses, the more likely and able they are to take care of themselves 
          when something unfortunate occurs. Healthcare is extremely expessive and can be responsible for putting many individuals and 
        families into a debt they won't be able to climb out of.</p>
          <p class="lead">To take the example of those in poverty versus who has healthcare, you can see an obvious trend.
            Not surprisingly, the higher percentage of those in poverty, the more that lack healthcare. Again, healthcare is expensive,
          so this chart should not seem out of left field. Also, a lot of people get healthcare through work, and odds are if you live in
        poverty you either are not employed, or potentially employed by a company that can't offer healthcare. If you live in poverty you  may have a 
      job, but that job might not pay enough to get you out of poverty, and still be able to afford healthcare.</p>
