# Pittsburgh Crime Analysis

Scope of Analysis: 

We will be collecting data on Pittsburgh Crime (2016-2019) and how it relates to:

-Weather (rain, snow, sunny, when is there more crime?)

-Crime frequency vs Incident location (which parts of Pittsburgh have the highest crime rates? Does location matter?)

-Analyzing the relationship between how severe a crime is and where it happens (do more severe crimes happen in the same    location(s), crime frequency in city zones vs police zones, which zones are “safer”? is there a pattern?)

-Crime vs time (time of day, time of the week, time of the year, we want to recognize when these crimes are actually happening).

-What percentage of each age group is responsible for crimes in Pittsburgh (what about gender or race?)
